Happy birthday, Mike!


Proposed improvements to the app / pipedreams (at 10.03.21): 
- addition of arcade scoring. As arcade has negative as well as positive, we'll need to change the interface to allow this (HW)
- float celebration image in centre of screen; add subtle animation to fly-in and dismiss (HW)
- add haptics / audio to celebration image (can be muted) (HW)
- yelldesignify the launch screen (HW)
- add an 'about' or 'help' section from launch screen to define undo and restart (HW)
- add a leaderboard, noting that this could involve entering names before the game begins, or after the game has been won (HW)
- add analytics and/or mementos: number of games played today, notable moments etc (requires data persistence) (HW)
